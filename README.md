About this assignment
In this assignment, I was tasked with taking a sample website, and improving its accessibility. I did this by adding semantic html tags to the various elements that the page contains, and adding descriptive alt texts to the images, in order to improve the user experience for sight impaired users. In addition to this, I went through the code and made sure it was layed out in a logical manner.

From this assignment I learned some very valuable lessons such as; how to use semantic tags in html, what makes a good alt text, and how to write a README file.
